# What are the instructions actually telling us to do?

## Part 1

- We need to discover a password to a safe
- The safe has a round dial with numbers from 0 to 99
- You rotate the dial to move it
- Each "click" of the dial represents an increment of one
- Rotations can be either left (L) or right (R)
- Each rotation has a distance which indicates how many clicks it should be moved by
- Turning the dial left from 0 by 1 makes it go to 99
- Turning the dial right from 99 by 1 makes it go to 0
- The dial starts by pointing at 50
